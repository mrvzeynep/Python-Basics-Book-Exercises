# print() is a function
# a function is a bit of code that typically takes some input, called argument
#does something with that input, and produces some ouput, a called return value.

#errors
#there are two main types of errors you will experience
#syntax errors : occurs when you write some code that isn't allowed in the pyhton lang.
#run-time errors : idle catches  syntax error before a program starts running,
#but some errors can't be caught until a program is executed. 


#variables
#variables keep values accesbile
#variables give values context 

#the assignment operator

phrase = "hello, world"
print(phrase)

# in the first line, a variable named phrase is created and assigned the value
#hello, world using the "=" operator 
# whenever you see = operator, whatever is to the right of it is being assigned
#to a variable on the left.

#variable names are case-sensitive.
#descriptive names are better than short names.
# in pyhton, it is more common to write variable names in snake case like num_students.
#every letter is lower case, and each word is seperated by an underscore.

x = 2 
y = '2'
print(x)
print(y)  # when you execute them, the output doesn't change, but the data types are not the same.
